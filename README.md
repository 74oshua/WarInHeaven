A combat focused space game that simulates N-body physics. Skybox asset not included in repo, you will need to add it [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/real-stars-skybox-lite-116333) if you plan of building the game yourself.

Controls:

`W`/`A`/`S`/`D`/`R`/`F` to orient spacecraft (directions always relative to camera)

`Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right`/`Shift`/`Control` to translate with RCS (again, relative to camera)

`Spacebar` to burn main engine

`V` to toggle overview

`Right` click and drag to rotate camera

`T` to set primary target to whatever the camera is facing

`Tab` to cycle between all visible targets

Weapons are bound to "fire groups." To target something with firegroup 1, press `F1`. To fire on the selected target, press `1`.
Other fire groups work similarly.
In the default scene, coilguns are bound to group 1 and missiles are bound to group 2.
